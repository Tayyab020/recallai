# PWA Installation Guide ðŸ“±

## What I've Added

âœ… **Install Button in Navbar**: Shows when app can be installed
âœ… **PWA Context**: Manages installation state and prompts
âœ… **Install Dialog**: Beautiful modal explaining benefits
âœ… **Test Page**: `/pwa-test` to test PWA features
âœ… **Notification Support**: Request push notification permissions
âœ… **Offline Detection**: Shows online/offline status

## How It Works

### 1. Install Button Appearance
The "Install App" button appears in the top-right navbar when:
- Browser supports PWA installation
- App meets PWA criteria
- App is not already installed
- User hasn't dismissed the install prompt

### 2. Installation Process
1. User clicks "Install App" button
2. Browser shows native install dialog
3. User confirms installation
4. App is added to desktop/home screen
5. Button changes to show "installed" status

### 3. PWA Features
- **Standalone Mode**: Runs like a native app
- **Offline Support**: Works without internet
- **Push Notifications**: Reminder alerts
- **Fast Loading**: Cached resources
- **Desktop Integration**: Taskbar/dock icon
