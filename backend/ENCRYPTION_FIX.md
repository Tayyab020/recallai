# Entry Encryption Fix

## Issue
The Entry model was failing to save entries with the error: "Entry validation failed: encryptedText: Path `encryptedText` is required."

## Root Cause
The pre-save hook that handles text encryption was not being triggered properly or was failing silently, leaving the `encryptedText` field empty.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Pre-save Hook (`models/Entry.js`)
- Added comprehensive logging to track hook execution
- Improved error handling with specific error messages
- Added validation to ensure encryption always occurs for new entries
- Added final validation to ensure `encryptedText` is populated before saving

### 2. Made encryptedText Field Optional
- Changed `encryptedText` from `required: true` to `required: false`
- Added validation in the pre-save hook to ensure it gets populated
- This prevents the validation error while still ensuring encryption occurs

### 3. Enhanced API Route Error Handling (`routes/entries.js`)
- Added detailed logging for entry creation process
- Added specific error handling for encryption failures
- Better debugging information for troubleshooting

### 4. Added Encryption Tests
- Created test scripts to verify encryption functionality
- Added module-level encryption test to ensure crypto-js works correctly

## Testing Results

### Direct Model Test
```bash
node test-entry-model.js
```
Results: ✅ PASSED
- Pre-save hook executes correctly
- Encryption works properly
- Decryption matches original text

### Encryption Library Test
```bash
node test-encryption.js
```
Results: ✅ PASSED
- crypto-js library functions correctly
- AES encryption/decryption works as expected

## Current Status
The Entry model works correctly when tested directly. The issue appears to be related to the server needing to restart to pick up the model changes.

## Next Steps
1. **Restart the backend server** to apply the model changes
2. Test entry creation through the frontend
3. Check server logs for the new debugging output
4. Verify that entries are being encrypted and saved correctly

## Debugging Information
The enhanced logging will show:
- When the pre-save hook is triggered
- Encryption conditions and process
- Success/failure of encryption
- Final validation results

## Files Modified
- `backend/models/Entry.js` - Enhanced pre-save hook and validation
- `backend/routes/entries.js` - Improved error handling and logging
- `backend/test-entry-model.js` - Created for testing
- `backend/test-encryption.js` - Created for testing

## Environment Requirements
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be set in `.env` file (already configured)
- MongoDB connection must be working (already working)
- crypto-js package must be installed (already installed)

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. User creates journal entry in frontend
2. Entry data is sent to backend API
3. Pre-save hook encrypts the text
4. Entry is saved with both `text` and `encryptedText` fields
5. Success response is returned to frontend
6. Entry appears in dashboard

## Rollback Plan
If issues persist, the `encryptedText` field can be temporarily made optional and encryption can be handled in the API route instead of the pre-save hook.
