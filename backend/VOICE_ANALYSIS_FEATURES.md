# Voice Analysis and Smart Reminders Implementation

## Overview
Implemented advanced voice analysis using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model to automatically extract important events and daily reminders from voice recordings, with automatic reminder creation and alarm-type notifications.

## New Features

### 1. Voice Analysis Service (`services/voiceAnalysisService.js`)
- **Audio Upload**: Supports multiple audio formats (WebM, WAV, MP3, M4A, OGG)
- **AI Analysis**: Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash for intelligent content extraction
- **Event Detection**: Identifies meetings, appointments, and important events
- **Reminder Extraction**: Finds tasks, to-dos, and time-sensitive items
- **Structured Output**: Returns JSON with categorized results

#### Analysis Output Format:
```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "title": "Meeting with client",
      "description": "Discuss project requirements",
      "type": "event",
      "priority": "high",
      "suggestedDateTime": "2024-01-15 14:00",
      "category": "work"
    }
  ],
  "reminders": [
    {
      "title": "Buy groceries",
      "description": "Get milk, bread, and eggs",
      "type": "reminder",
      "priority": "medium",
      "suggestedDateTime": "2024-01-14 18:00",
      "category": "personal"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Brief summary of audio content"
}
```

### 2. Smart Reminder Service (`services/reminderService.js`)
- **Automatic Creation**: Creates reminders from voice analysis results
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Uses suggested times or defaults to reasonable times
- **Cron-based Alarms**: Real-time reminder triggering with cron jobs
- **Push Notifications**: Web push notifications for reminder alerts
- **Recurring Support**: Handles daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly reminders

#### Reminder Features:
- **Priority Levels**: High, medium, low priority classification
- **Categories**: Work, personal, health, family, finance, education, general
- **Source Tracking**: Links reminders back to original journal entries
- **Metadata Storage**: Preserves original AI analysis for reference

### 3. Enhanced Reminder Model (`models/Reminder.js`)
Added new fields to support voice-generated reminders:
- `triggerTime`: Exact date/time for reminder execution
- `category`: Categorization for better organization  
- `sourceType`: Tracks how reminder was created (voice-analysis, manual, etc.)
- `sourceEntryId`: Links to originating journal entry
- `metadata`: Stores original AI analysis and confidence scores
- `triggerCount`: Tracks how many times reminder has fired
- `completedAt`: Timestamp when reminder was completed

### 4. New API Endpoints (`routes/voiceAnalysis.js`)

#### POST `/api/voice/analyze-reminders`
- Upload audio file for reminder analysis
- Multipart form data with audio file
- Optional automatic reminder creation

#### POST `/api/voice/transcribe-analyze`  
- Combined transcription and analysis in one request
- Returns both text transcription and structured analysis
- Efficient for complete voice processing

#### POST `/api/voice/analyze-base64`
- Analyze audio from base64 data (compatible with existing frontend)
- Supports automatic reminder creation
- Used by journal entry creation flow

#### POST `/api/voice/create-reminders`
- Create reminders from existing analysis results
- Allows manual review before reminder creation
- Links reminders to specific journal entries

### 5. Enhanced Entry Creation Flow
Updated journal entry creation to automatically:
- Analyze voice recordings for actionable items
- Extract events and reminders using AI
- Create automatic reminders with smart scheduling
- Provide feedback on analysis results
- Link reminders back to journal entries

### 6. Frontend Integration (`pages/EntryForm.js`)
- **Voice Analysis Button**: "Find Reminders" button for manual analysis
- **Automatic Analysis**: Analyzes voice during entry creation
- **Results Display**: Shows found events/reminders and created reminders
- **User Feedback**: Clear success messages with analysis results

## Technical Implementation

### Audio Processing Pipeline:
1. **Audio Capture**: MediaRecorder API captures audio in browser
2. **Format Detection**: Automatic MIME type detection and fallbacks
3. **File Upload**: Temporary file creation for Gemini API
4. **AI Analysis**: Gemini 2.0 Flash processes audio with structured prompts
5. **Result Processing**: JSON parsing and validation
6. **Reminder Creation**: Automatic scheduling with cron jobs
7. **Cleanup**: Temporary file removal

### Scheduling System:
- **Cron Jobs**: Individual cron tasks for each reminder
- **Time Zones**: UTC-based scheduling with proper conversion
- **Persistence**: Reminders survive server restarts
- **Cleanup**: Automatic removal of completed one-time reminders

### Notification System:
- **Web Push**: Browser notifications using VAPID keys
- **Fallback**: Console logging when push not available
- **Rich Notifications**: Title, body, icon, and action buttons
- **Deep Linking**: Notifications link to relevant app sections

## Usage Examples

### Voice Input Examples:
- *"I have a doctor appointment tomorrow at 2 PM"*
  → Creates high-priority health reminder for 2 PM tomorrow

- *"Don't forget to call mom this weekend"*
  → Creates medium-priority family reminder for weekend

- *"Meeting with the team on Friday to discuss the project"*
  → Creates high-priority work event for Friday

- *"Need to buy groceries after work"*
  → Creates medium-priority personal reminder for evening

### API Usage:
```javascript
// Analyze voice for reminders
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('audio', audioFile);
formData.append('createReminders', 'true');

const response = await fetch('/api/voice/analyze-reminders', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData,
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(`Found ${result.analysis.reminders.length} reminders`);
console.log(`Created ${result.createdReminders} automatic reminders`);
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Required for AI analysis
